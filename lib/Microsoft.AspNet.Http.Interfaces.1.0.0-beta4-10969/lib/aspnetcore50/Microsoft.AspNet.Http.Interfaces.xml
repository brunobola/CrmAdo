            <summary>
            Provides information regarding TLS token binding parameters.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            TLS token bindings help mitigate the risk of impersonation by an attacker in the
            event an authenticated client's bearer tokens are somehow exfiltrated from the
            client's machine. See https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-popov-token-binding/
            for more information.

            supply a 'provided' token binding or valid proof of possession of the
